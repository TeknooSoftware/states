/**
 * Class Standard
 * Variant of default Proxy class to use in stated class when no proxy are defined in these classes.
 *
 * A stated class instance is a proxy, configured for its stated class, with its different stated class instances.
 * It is a proxy because, by default, all calls are redirected to enabled states.
 * $this in all methods of the stated class instance (also of states' methods) points the proxy object.
 *
 * The library creates an alias with the proxy class name and this default proxy to simulate a dedicated proxy
 * to this class.
 *
 * This proxy is a variant of the default proxy to allow developer to create an instance a stated class
 * like another class with the operator new.
