/**
 * Class AbstractState
 * Standard  implementation of the state interface, representing states entities in stated class.
 *
 * Objects implementing this interface must
 * return a usable closure via the method getClosure() for the required method. This method must able to be rebinded
 * by the Closure api (The proxy use \Closure::call() to rebind self and $this). These objects must also provide a
 * \ReflectionMethod instance for theirs state's methods and check also if the proxy instance can access to a private
 * or protected method.
 *
 * State's methods are not directly used by the proxy instance. They are a builder to create the closure, they must
 * return them self the closure. So, writing state differs from previous version, example :
 *
 *      <method visibility> function <method name>(): \Closure
 *      {
 *          return function() {
 *              //your code
 *          };
 *      }
 *      method visibility : public/protected/private, visibility used in the proxy instance, for your method
 *      method name: a string, used in the proxy, for your method.
 *
 * Contrary to previous versions of this library, methods of states's object are not directly converted into a \Closure.
 * Since 7.0, \Closure created from the Reflection Api can not be rebinded to an another class (only rebind of $this
 * is permitted), so the feature \Closure::call() was not usable. Since 7.1, rebind $this for this special closure
 * is also forbidden.
 *
 * WARNING: The AbstractState can not acccess to private method in state (Because parent classes can not access to
 * privates methods of child classes, and vice versa). To allow access to private, you must create a class implementing
 * directly the StateInterface and use directly the StateTrait.
