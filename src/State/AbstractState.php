/**
 * Class AbstractState
 * Standard  implementation of the state interface, representing states entities in stated class.
 *
 * Default implementation of the state interface, representing states entities in stated class.
 * A trait implementation has been chosen to allow developer to write theirs owns factory, extendable from any class.
 *
 * Objects implementing this interface must find, bind and execute closure via the method executeClosure() for the
 * required method. (Rebind must use \Closure::call() to rebind static, self and $this or rebindTo()).
 *
 * Objects must follow instruction passed to executeClosure() and manage the visibility of the method and not allow
 * executing a private method from an outside call.
 *
 * Result must be injected to the proxy by using the callback passed to executeClosure(). It's allowed to execute a
 * method without inject the result into the proxy instance to allow developers to call several methods. But you can
 * only inject one result by call. (Several implementations available at a same time is forbidden by the proxy
 * interface).
 *
 * Static method are not managed (a class can not have a state, only it's instance).
 *
 * State's methods are not directly executed. They are a builder to create the closure, they must
 * return them self the closure. So, writing state differs from previous version, example :
 *
 *      <method visibility> function <method name>(): \Closure
 *      {
 *          return function($arg1, $arg2) {
 *              //your code
 *          };
 *      }
 *      method visibility : public/protected/private, visibility used in the proxy instance, for your method
 *      method name: a string, used in the proxy, for your method.
 *
 * Contrary to previous versions of this library, methods of states's object are not directly converted into a \Closure.
 * Since 7.0, \Closure created from the Reflection Api can not be bound to an another class (only rebind of $this
 * is permitted), so the feature \Closure::call() was not usable. Since 7.1, rebind $this for this special closure
 * is also forbidden.
