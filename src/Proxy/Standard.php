namespace UniAlteri\States\Proxy;

/**
 * Class Standard
 * Default implementation of the proxy class in stated classes. It can not be instantiate directly by the developer,
 * it must use the factory to create a new instance of this stated class.
 * It is also used in this library to create stated class instance.
 *
 * A stated class instance is a proxy instance, configured from the stated class's factory, with different states instance.
 * The proxy, by default, redirect all calls, on non defined methods in the proxy, to enabled states.
 * $this in all methods of the stated class instance (in proxy's method and states' methods) represent the proxy instance.
 *
 * By default, this library creates an alias with the canonical proxy class name and the stated class name
 * to simulate a real class with the stated class name.
 *
 * If a stated class has no proxy, an another alias is create from this standard proxy with the proxyless stated class name.
