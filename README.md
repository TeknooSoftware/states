Welcome and thank you to having downloaded this library. 
It's allow you to create PHP classes following the [State Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) in PHP7+. 
This can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to large monolithic conditional statements and thus improve maintainability.
