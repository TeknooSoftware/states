## [3.1.0-rc1] - 2017-10-12
### Release
- First RC.
- Update QA Tools

## [3.1.0-beta3] - 2017-10-01
### Updated

### Updated
- Update dev libraries used for this project and use now PHPUnit 6.2 for tests.

## [3.1.0-beta1] - 2017-06-30

 `StatesBundle` is not mandatory and not very usefull.

## [3.0.1] - 2017-02-15
### Fix
- Code style fix
- License file follow Github specs
- Add tools to checks QA, use `make qa` and `make test`, `make` to initalize the project, (or `composer update`).

### Remove
- Support of PHP 5.4 and PHP 5.5

## [3.0.0] - 2017-01-06
### Release
- Final release

## [3.0.0-beta1] - 2016-12-21
### Release
- First beta

## [3.0.0-alpha4] - 2016-10-31
### Fixed
* Fix code style

## [3.0.0-alpha3] - 2016-10-27
### Fixed
* Documentation
* Can use original full qualified state name for redefined/overloaded state by children stated class.

### Removed
* getMethodDescription() to get a description about a method. Conflict between \ReflecionMethod of closure builder
  and the \ReflectionFunction of the final closure. 

## [3.0.0-alpha2] - 2016-10-07
### Fixed
* Fix a bug in loading service without namespace

## [3.0.0-alpha1] - 2016-10-03
### Added/Changed
* State identifier must be a valid class name or a valid interface name. The state object must implements, 
  instantiates or inherits this class/interface name.
* States must be now directly declared into the proxy via the static method statesListDeclaration.
  
### Changed
* Standard proxies can be directly instantiate by PHP.
* States's method are now builders of closure : They must return a closure, bindable with \Closure::call(). 
  The Reflection API is no longer used to get a closure.
* The library uses \Closure::call() instead of \Closure::rebindTo(), more efficient.  
* The library uses now native array instead of \ArrayObject. Array's performances are good with PHP7+ and 
    using array forbid change in proxy without using API.
* MagicCallTrait forward `__toString()` call to the method `toString()` and `__invoke()` call to the method `invoke()`.

### Removed
* Useless state alias feature.
* Registration of states via theirs short name.
* State's factories, they become useless because states must be directly declared in the proxy.
* Loader feature, they become useless because states must be directly declared in the proxy.
* CLI Command, the States 3.x needs less operations to be started.
* Integrated proxies, Standard proxies can be now directly instantiate by PHP.  
* bootstrap.php file
* Joker "Of[SateName]" to specify the state to use to call a method.

## [2.1.1] - 2016-10-03
### Fixed
- Remove support of PHP 7.1+ of State 2.* because PHP 7.1 introduce a major BC Break on the Reflection API and forbid
rebind $this in closure created from the Reflection API.

## [2.1.0] - 2016-08-23
### Added
- Can use the full qualified state'name (full state' class name, with its namespace) instead its identifier (class name only)
 for proxy's methods:  
    * registerState
    * unregisterState
    * switchState
    * enableState
    * disableState
    * inState
 example $instance->switchState(MyState::class); instead of $instance->switchState('MyState');
