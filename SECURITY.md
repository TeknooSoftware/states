## Reporting a Vulnerability

Basicly, send an email to `richard@teknoo.software` with the vulnerability description and a proof of concept of the exploit.
This is a free project, written on my free time, so: there are no bug bounty, but you will be credited in the version's description, changelog and the contributors list.

Thanks
