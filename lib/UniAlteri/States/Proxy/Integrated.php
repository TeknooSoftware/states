/**
 * Class Standard
 * @package UniAlteri\States\Proxy
 * Variant of default Proxy class to use in stated class when no proxy are defined in these classes.
 *
 * A stated object is a proxy, configured for its stated class, with its different states objects.
 * It is a proxy because, by default, all calls are redirected to enabled states.
 * $this in all methods of the stated object (also of states'methods) points the proxy object.
 *
 * The library create an alias with the class's proxy name and this default proxy
 * to simulate a dedicated proxy to this class
 *
 * This proxy is a variant of the default proxy to allow developer to instanciate a stated class like another class
 * wit the operator new
